# Zekuru: The Channels Auto-Translator Bot
## About
Made by Zekumoru. Exclusive for zone 144's Discord server. (Otherwise my usage will de-stonks if public.)

## Commands
### Usage
#### DeepL Usage

```
/deepl-usage
```

Returns the usage count, remaining characters, and the limit of DeepL's translation service.

#### Google Usage

```
/google-usage
```

Returns the usage count, remaining characters, and the limit of Google's Cloud Translate translation service.

## Remarks

My code is messy and it was put together very quickly with "making it work as soon as possible" in mind. So don't expect to see well-written code here since I was also new to DiscordJS, Node.js, and MongoDB!

> The limits are based on my accounts by the way.
